			name: "Grady Luyt",
			title: "Tech Captain",
			bio: <p>
				This is Grady’s fourth year on the team, and he’s looking forward to the 2022 build season. With
				2020 being cut short and 2021 being virtual, Grady has big goals for the team this year with it
				being his last. On the rare times where Grady isn’t working on the robot, you can usually find him
				trying to break into Sage’s safety prize candy safe.

		},
		{
			name: "Sage Brown",
			title: "Non Tech and Safety Captain",
			bio: <p>Sage spent her freshman and sophomore year on the build team and started doing safety her junior
				year. She’s now a senior and is excited to participate with non tech and safety at comps since she
				couldn’t last year. When she’s not at robotics, Sage can be found cross-country skiing or starting
				her AP Lit reductions the night before they’re due.
			</p>,
			image: leadImageSageBrown
		},
		{
			name: "Miles Lettinga",
			title: "Build Lead and Driver",
			bio: <p>
				This is Miles’ second year with the RAPTORS; he previously competed with 4338 in Israel. Miles’
				favorite part of FIRST is meeting new people and being to learn new things with the team. Miles’ is
				looking forward to this season and has big goals like advancing to worlds. When Miles isn’t
				building a robot, he’s busy with his AP Chemistry and Calculus homework.
			</p>,
			image: leadImageMilesLettinga
		},
		{
			name: "Ian Elder",
			title: "Electrical Lead",
			bio: <p>
				Ian’s been doing electrical for three years on the team and loves “the holy sparkiness of 120 volt
				AC” (but don’t tell Sage about all the sparks he makes). When he isn’t making sparks, you can find
				Ian in his car, outside the room, waiting for robotics to start.
			</p>,
			image: leadImageIanElder
		},
		{
			name: "Gabriel Seaver",
			title: "Programming Lead",
			bio: <p>
				This is Gabriel’s third year sitting in the dark corner on his fancy computer. Last year, Gabriel
				programmed a reusable code library for swerve drive for our robot. When Gabriel is not programming,
				you can find him “crying about AP Lang”.
